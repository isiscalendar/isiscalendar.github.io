      <title>Note on EA river restrictions</title>

      <description>Some of the events listed in these pages will have river restrictions in place. A river restriction is granted by the EA and gives permission to hold up river traffic for a short period of time. Marshalls ensure a clear navigation channel to other users e.g. in between divisions.
It is NOT the same as a closure, which are much more difficult and expensive to arrange.
You can see the latest Thames river restriction and closures here: https://www.</description>
